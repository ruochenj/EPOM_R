# EPOM_R
EPOM is an R package implemented based on the paper Epigenome overlap measure (EPOM) for comparing tissue/
cell types based on chromatin states by Wei Vivian Li, Zahra S. Razaee and Jingyi Jessica Li (2016).

Before using the package, you can check EPOM-vignette.pdf and EPOM.pdf.
epom_func_test.R will be a good reference as well.
